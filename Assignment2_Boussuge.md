Topic Modeling Visualization Written Response 

I selected my data from dfr.jstor.org, which is a website that allows users to find mass data for research (DFR). As I looked at possible journals to choose data from I fell on “Folk music journal” which seemed very interesting to me as I have always loved folk music and the culture surrounding it. I also chose the “Folk music journal” as it contained roughly 1,600 articles which I thought was an appropriate length for topic modeling as it was a large enough corpus to find specific trends in while not being too big that it would take too much time to load when upload and downloading it.  In addition my time frame for the journal was between the years 1964 to 2013, and I used a mixed of book reviews, research articles, miscellaneous articles and news articles.

I chose to use 20 topics as it seemed to be the perfect middle ground. 25 was too many topics as my corpus was not that large so the cluster of words would not be strongly enough similar to each other. Any smaller than 20 would have been trying to put too many different terms under the same topic.

Looking at the topics we can see many repeating terms and common shared themes that many of these articles shared. Common terms that appeared where “morris” “dance” and specific regions such as Ireland, Wales, and Scotland are recurring. The topics are all generally intertwined and talk about the origins and key parts of folk culture. 

As Megan R. Brett puts it in her article called: Topic Modeling: A Basic Introduction, she states: “Topic modeling is not necessarily useful as evidence but it makes an excellent tool for discovery.” [1] Topic modeling has many possibilities such as being able to find clusters of similar words in large bodies of texts, allowing us to find trends and themes in a corpus. As Scott B. Weingart and Elijah Meeks stated: topic modeling “is distant reading in the most pure sense: focused on corpora and not individual texts, treating the works themselves as unceremonious “buckets of words,”” [2]  topic modeling creates “seductive but obscure results in the forms of easily interpreted (and manipulated) “topics.” [2] The possibilities of topic modeling are in a sense endless, you can apply it to most fields of studies such as the sciences, maths, and even politics. “Topic modeling has been applied to datasets in multiple domains, from bioinformatics to comparative literature, and to documents ranging in size from monographs to tweets.” [2]
However, topic modeling does have its downsides. When referring to Laurel Thatcher Ulrich and Cameron Blevins work regarding topic modeling, Megan R. Brett says that “Both Blevins and Ulrich had to be familiar with the content of the diary and its historical context in order to make sense of their findings.” [1] In other words, you need to be familiar with the information you are dealing with before topic modeling. This means if you are topic modeling a corpus, understand what is inside that corpus and what is it talking about so that you have context to the cluster of words in each topic that is created. Scott B. Weingart and Elijah Meeks explain another limitation or danger that comes with topic modeling, this is the idea that topic modeling gives scholars a false sense of knowledge on a the result of the topic modeling. They warn in: “a call for caution in the use of topic modeling because it moves scholars away from interpreting language — their great strength — toward interpreting “topics,” an ill-defined act which might provide the false security of having resolved the distinction between a word and the thing that it represents.” [2]
