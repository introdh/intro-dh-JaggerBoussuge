### 2017-09-18: Distant reading


						
# “A scholar specializes in early-twentieth-century poetry. Presumably, this scholar could be called upon to provide sound generalizations, or “macro readings,” of twentieth-century poetry based on a broad familiarity with the individual works of that period. is would be a type of “macro” or “distant” reading.*” - This is my AHA! Moment as it clarified what the author meant by distant reading in the context of literature.

		 	 	 		
			
				
					
						
# “In literary studies, we are drawn to and impressed by grand theories, by deep and extended interpretations, and by complex speculations about what a text— or even a part of a text—might mean: the indeterminacies of deconstruction, the rami cations of postcolonialism, or how, for example, the manifold allusions in Joyce’s Ulysses extend the meaning of the core text.” I did not understand what this passage meant. Is the author just listing examples of “grand theories”?
