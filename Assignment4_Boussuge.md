# The Data: What is it?

The data I selected for my analysis was from a list of all 26,000 US Supreme Court cases from 1791 to 2005. The Washington University in St. Louis assigned each supreme court cases to a legal issue. I chose to look at Supreme Court cases that were classified under issue 20060, 20030, and 20070 which is regarding ballot access (of candidates and political parties), employment discrimination: on basis of race, age, religion, illegitimacy, national origin, or working conditions and affirmative action.  When creating a network with the data I created a network looking at the the years and centrality. Plot centrality shows which cases were cited the most and years show when (what year) the cases regarding those issues were brought to the supreme court. I was curious to see if there was any overlap or correlation between these different legal issues.  “Network analysis maps and measures relationships, for example, people, groups, computers, or information.” (Fowler, 2007)

# Questions that the data generates:

After looking at the networks created with my data on years, I was shocked to see that most cases regarding ballot access, employment condition and affirmative action where 1970 onwards. This makes me wonder if this is a result of the systematic discrimination prior to the civil rights era. Does this say something about where our society is going? Are we improving by bringing these injustice to court and to the public eye?

The network that focuses on centrality uses the eigenvector centrality approach. This “approaches to identifying relevant cases assumes that only inward citations contain information about importance.” (Fowler, 2007) The nodes further away from the center are a dark purple in contrast to the the lime green and yellow which represents a much higher value on the eigen scale.

# Possibility and limits of network analysis

“The network method allows us to determine the extent to which cases become more or less relevant over time, in comparison to other cases in the network, in a more valid way than extant measures.” (Fowler, 2007)
As with almost everything there are limitations with network analysis. In his conclusion Fowler puts it as: “There is much more work to be done.” He explains that hopefully more people show interest in networks and attempt to use “network techniques to probe the extent to which judges are influenced py precedent when they decide which cases to cite.”  As well as “to understand the development of the norm of stare decisive in American Law.” (Fowler, 2007)
