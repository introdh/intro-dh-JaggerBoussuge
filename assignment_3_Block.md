# Process of building the map

Georeferencing in the GIS field is a process in which we overlay geographic data over a physical map of a certain location or space. I picked Miami for my map since I grew up there and was familiar with the surrounding neighborhoods . We used a program called ArcMap to build our map. The first step was to lay down a standard map of the city which was called a “topographic map”, this map showed the basic details of the city: streets, neighborhoods and even bodies of water. Once I had my map I added my data to the map. My data was the “residential security map” that was “prepared by the division of research and statistics at the federal home loan bank board”, basically it was redlining data of greater Miami from 1937. Once I added that map to my original basemap, I clicked on a tool called “Georeferencing” this connected our two maps. In order to get a more specific and accurate pairing I used “control points” which I attached to the same locations on both maps. After adding roughly 15 points my data was perfectly placed over the basemap with little distortion.

# Contextualize my map

The 1937 map of Miami shows what we call “redlining”. Redlining was a practice which divided neighborhoods/regions into areas that were graded depending on how desirable they were to live. The highest grade is an A followed by B, C and D. One of the key factors in the categorization of these areas was race and diversity. “The presence of race-restrictive covenants aimed at painting homogeneity.”(Hiller, Page 80) In other words the fourth Grade or the “D” areas” was categorised based on ““an undesirable population or an infiltration of it” referring largely to the presence of Jews and African Americans” (Hiller, Pg. 80) This shows how racist redlining was, the less diverse an area's population was the higher grade it was given. The point of redlining was to give banks and other financial institutions a guide to who to give a loan and mortgage to and who not to depending on where they live, resulting in minorities being heavily disadvantaged and discriminated against financially. 

# Questions my map generated about the past and the present

After looking at my map I started to think what the legacy of redlining has left for us in today's society.  Are areas that were deemed “undesirable” still considered “undesirable” today? Has the legacy of redlining kept our society racially segregated? Sadly, looking at the map I found that in many cases the legacy of redlining is still seen today. Areas that were deemed “undesirable” due to a large African American or Latino presence are still largely African American and Latino, and areas rated A and B grade are still largely white. Minority filled neighborhoods are still predominantly poorer than their white counterparts and therefore still considered “undesirable”. I guess this brings up larger questions such as: what does this say about our society? Is redlining just another factor of the failures of the reconstruction? What can we do as a society to fix this?

# Neighborhood have they or haven't they changed?

Using the social explorer I searched to see the African American population demographics in Miami. To my earlier point I noticed many neighborhoods have not changed.
This first map shows the 2015 census of areas with a high population of African Americans. The second map shows the 2015 census of household making less than $20,000 yearly. This is below the poverty line which is roughly around $22,000 for the USA. Finally the last map is the original redlining map of miami in 1937. All three maps have correlating data. The areas with a high population of African Americans also are places with high rates of poverty, and finally are the same areas with low grades in the 1937 redlining map.

# Limitations of the map

According to Bodenhamer, GIS can help “users ... discover relationships that make a complex world more immediately understandable by visually detecting spatial patterns that remain hidden in texts and tables.” (Bodenhamer, page 4) Even though GIS is extremely helpful in visualizing and explaining a concept, this map has it’s limitations. Essentially this project simply shows data points on a map, which definitely helps prove a point and/or give evidence to a humanities statement. However, this is all quantitative, it would be nice to have some qualitative data as well that is not shown on this map. This could possibly be in the form of primary sources such as interviews with those marginalized by redlining / those who redlined.
