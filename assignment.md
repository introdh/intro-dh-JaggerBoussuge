##Digital Humainties Data on correlation between a Country's wealth and their population's health
The humanities topic that guided me through the collection of data was wether or not there was a correlation between money and health. I was trying to answer the question: Do countries with a stronger economy and less poverty had a healthier population? My theory is that poorer countries can’t afford proper medical facilities and treatment for their people therefore are more likely to have a higher infant mortality rate and more people living with HIV/AIDS then wealthier more developed countries. In addition to data on infant mortality and people living with HIV/AIDS I added obesity rate, to show that wealthy countries also deal with health issues just different ones then poorer countries. In order to measure a country’s wealth, I collected data on GDP per capita, primary labour force and population living below poverty line. My source is the CIA world Factbook. I trust it because it is a government run site that many scholars use. https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/
