## Question/ Abstract

Here in your repository, write your answers to the following: 

(1) Formulate the humanities question(s) guiding the project. 

- In the last 20 years what certain words/phrases help make a rap song popular in the United States?
- What trends can we find in the lyrics of rap music? In other words what are the main topics talked about in rap music?
- Do vulgarity/obsenity in lyrics help make a rap song popular?

(2) Provide a one-paragraph abstract written for a nonspecialist audience, clearly explaining the projectâ€™s principal activities and its expected results.

- The characterstics of a strong abstract: Using topic modeling we will analyze the lyrics of numerous rap songs and find which words appear more frequently. In order to do this we will gather lyrics of rap songs that have made the top 40 charts in the hip/hop category and run them through mallet in order to pile frequently used words and common phrases. The purpose of this project is to figure out if certain words/phrases help make a rap song popular.

- explains the humanities question(s) guiding the project
- includes the DH methods that will be used and why
- identifies which humanities fields/ disciplines the project is engaged in
